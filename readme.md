# Employee Productivity and Work Environment Dataset

## Dataset Overview
This dataset contains data collected from 50 employees across various departments within an organization. The goal of the dataset is to analyze the relationship between employee work habits, environmental factors, and their overall performance.

## Features:
- **Work Hours**: The number of hours worked per day by the employee.
- **Sleep Hours**: The average number of hours the employee sleeps per night.
- **Department**: The department in which the employee works (e.g., Marketing, IT, Sales, HR).
- **Attendance %**: The percentage of days the employee attends work during a given period.
- **Coffee Consumption**: The level of coffee consumption during work hours (None, Light, Heavy).
- **Performance Rating**: The overall performance rating of the employee (Excellent, Good, Average, Poor).

## Data Collection Method
The data was collected through a survey distributed to employees within the organization. Each participant provided information about their daily work habits, coffee consumption, sleep patterns, and attendance. Their performance was rated by their respective managers or supervisors, based on job performance evaluations conducted over a specified period.

## Sample Data (First 5 Rows):

| Work Hours | Sleep Hours | Department  | Attendance % | Coffee Consumption | Performance Rating |
|------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 8          | 6           | Marketing   | 90           | Light              | Excellent          |
| 7          | 7           | IT          | 95           | None               | Good               |
| 6          | 5           | Sales       | 80           | Heavy              | Average            |
| 9          | 8           | HR          | 100          | Light              | Excellent          |
| 7          | 6           | Marketing   | 85           | None               | Good               |

## Usage:
This dataset can be used to build machine learning models for predicting employee performance based on their work habits, attendance, and environmental factors. It can be used for **supervised learning** with **classification** algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Decision Trees.
